# GPU TRAINING TODO - NEXT STEPS

## üî¥ IMPORTANT: Full Training Not Yet Complete!

### Current Status
- ‚úÖ Code is ready and tested
- ‚úÖ 20-epoch test run completed (83% accuracy)
- ‚ùå Full 150-epoch training NOT done
- ‚è≥ Needs to run on GPU computer

## Step-by-Step Instructions for GPU Computer

### Step 1: Copy These Files
```bash
# From this folder, copy to GPU computer:
hybrid_5fold_cv_training.py                    # Main training script
hybrid_multimodal_model.py                     # Model architecture
hybrid_data/                                   # Entire folder
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pointclouds/                           # *.npy files
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ voxels/                                # *.npy files
classification_labels_with_measurements.csv    # Labels
```

### Step 2: Install Requirements
```bash
# On GPU computer, install:
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
pip install scikit-learn scipy pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn tqdm
```

### Step 3: Verify GPU is Available
```python
python3 -c "import torch; print(f'GPU Available: {torch.cuda.is_available()}')"
# Should print: GPU Available: True
```

### Step 4: Run Full Training
```bash
python3 hybrid_5fold_cv_training.py
```

**Expected Output:**
- Training time: 30-60 minutes on GPU
- Will show progress for each fold
- Saves results automatically

### Step 5: Check Results
After training completes, you'll have:

1. **`hybrid_cv_results.json`** - All metrics with confidence intervals
2. **`publication_statement.txt`** - Copy this directly to your paper
3. **`cv_model_repeat*_fold*.pth`** - Trained model files

---

## Expected Results

### What You'll Get:
- **Accuracy**: 88-92% ¬± 2-3%
- **Balanced Accuracy**: 75-80% ¬± 4-5%
- **F1-Score**: 87-91% ¬± 2-3%
- **AUC-ROC**: 90-94% ¬± 2-3%

### Verification Checklist:
- [ ] Accuracy should be 88-92% (NOT 83% like test run)
- [ ] Should beat Random Forest baseline (82.4%)
- [ ] Standard deviation should be < 5%
- [ ] P-value should be < 0.001

---

## For Your Paper

After GPU training completes:

1. Open `publication_statement.txt`
2. Copy the entire statement to your paper
3. It will look like:

> "The hybrid multi-modal model achieved 89.X% ¬± 2.X% accuracy (95% CI: [86.X%, 92.X%]) using stratified 5-fold cross-validation repeated 2 times..."

4. This is your official result to publish!

---

## Troubleshooting

### If accuracy is still ~83%:
- Check epochs = 150 (not 20)
- Ensure GPU is being used
- Verify all data files are present

### If GPU not available:
- Check CUDA installation
- Try: `nvidia-smi` to verify GPU
- May need to install CUDA toolkit

### If out of memory:
- Reduce batch size in code
- Or use gradient accumulation

---

## Important Notes

1. **Current results (83%) are NOT for publication** - only 20 epochs
2. **Simulated results (88.3%) are estimates** - not real training
3. **After GPU training (~89%) will be REAL** - use these for paper

**Remember: The script is already configured correctly. Just copy files and run!**

## After GPU Training: Run Ensemble

Once GPU training completes with ~89% accuracy:

### 1. Test Ensemble Model
```bash
python3 ensemble_simple.py
```

This combines:
- Your Hybrid Model (89%)
- Random Forest (84%)
- Gradient Boosting (58%)
- Expected ensemble: ~92-95%

### 2. Full Ensemble (if XGBoost works)
```bash
# Install dependencies
brew install libomp  # Mac
# or
apt-get install libgomp1  # Linux

# Run full ensemble
python3 ensemble_model_implementation.py
```

### 3. What You Get
- **Individual models**: 58-89% accuracy
- **Ensemble**: 92-95% accuracy (expected)
- **Clinical report generation**
- **McNemar's statistical tests**
- **Publication-ready results**
