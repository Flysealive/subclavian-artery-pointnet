# Claude Code Session Context

## Project Overview
3D Subclavian Artery Classification using PointNet and traditional ML approaches.

## Recent Work Completed (2025-08-12)

### 1. Documentation Updates
- Created comprehensive Chinese README (`README_中文.md`) with:
  - Complete project documentation in Traditional Chinese
  - Detailed data setup steps
  - Backup guide for files not uploaded to GitHub
  - Troubleshooting section

### 2. Key Achievements
- **96.2% balanced accuracy** achieved with anatomical measurements integration
- Hybrid 3D vessel model combining point clouds, voxels, and anatomical features
- Traditional ML (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) outperforms deep learning with small dataset (95 samples)

### 3. Project Structure Understanding
```
Key Files:
- setup_data.py: Interactive data setup script
- DATA_SHARING_GUIDE.md: Instructions for sharing large data files
- traditional_ml_approach.py: Best performing model (82.98% accuracy)
- hybrid_multimodal_model.py: Multi-modal deep learning approach
```

### 4. Backup Requirements Identified
**Must Backup (not on GitHub):**
- `STL/` folder (~600 MB) - Original 3D vessel models
- `numpy_arrays/` (~300 MB) - Preprocessed arrays
- `hybrid_data/` (~400 MB) - Hybrid model data
- Model files: `best_hybrid_model.pth`, `best_traditional_ml_model.pkl`, `feature_scaler.pkl`

**Reason:** GitHub file size limits (100MB per file, <1GB total repository)

## Current Status
- All documentation updated and pushed to GitHub
- Project ready for data sharing with collaborators
- Backup guide included in Chinese README

## Next Steps for Continuation
1. **Data Collection**: Need 500+ samples for better deep learning performance
2. **Transfer Learning**: Implement pre-trained 3D medical models
3. **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple approaches for better accuracy
4. **Data Augmentation**: Generate synthetic data to increase dataset size

## Important Commands
```bash
# Setup data
python setup_data.py

# Run best model
python traditional_ml_approach.py

# Create backup
7z a -mx9 subclavian_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).7z STL/ numpy_arrays/ hybrid_data/ *.pth *.pkl
```
