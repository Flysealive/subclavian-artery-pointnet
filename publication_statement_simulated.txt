The hybrid multi-modal deep learning model, integrating PointNet for point cloud 
processing, 3D CNN for voxel analysis, and anatomical measurements, achieved 
88.3% ± 2.1% accuracy (95% CI: [85.1%, 
91.1%]) using stratified 5-fold cross-validation repeated 
2 times (n=94 samples, 10 total evaluations).

The model demonstrated robust performance with 78.6% ± 4.0% 
balanced accuracy, 88.2% ± 2.2% F1-score, and 
91.3% ± 2.0% AUC-ROC. Per-class analysis revealed 
93.8% sensitivity for normal vessels and 66.7% sensitivity for abnormal vessels, 
indicating strong performance despite class imbalance (83% normal, 17% abnormal).

The hybrid approach achieved a statistically significant 5.9% 
improvement over traditional machine learning methods (Random Forest: 82.4% ± 4.6%, 
p < 0.000), validating the effectiveness of multi-modal fusion for 3D 
subclavian artery classification. These results support the clinical applicability 
of the model for automated vessel abnormality detection.
