## 🔴 TODO TASKS - RUN ON GPU COMPUTER

### STEP 1: Setup GPU Environment
```bash
# 1.1 Check GPU availability
nvidia-smi

# 1.2 Install Python dependencies
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
pip install scikit-learn scipy pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn tqdm
pip install xgboost  # Optional, for full ensemble

# 1.3 Verify CUDA
python3 -c "import torch; print(f'CUDA available: {torch.cuda.is_available()}')"
```

### STEP 2: Copy Required Files
```bash
# Copy these files from current computer to GPU computer:
# (Use USB, cloud storage, or network transfer)

# Essential files:
hybrid_5fold_cv_training.py              # Main training script
hybrid_multimodal_model.py               # Model architecture
hybrid_data/                             # Folder with data
├── pointclouds/*.npy                    # Point cloud files
└── voxels/*.npy                         # Voxel files
classification_labels_with_measurements.csv  # Labels

# For ensemble (after training):
ensemble_simple.py                       # Simple ensemble
ensemble_model_implementation.py         # Full ensemble
stl_features.pkl                        # Geometric features
```

### STEP 3: Run Full 5-Fold CV Training (150 epochs)
```bash
# This is the MAIN TASK - takes 30-60 minutes on GPU
python3 hybrid_5fold_cv_training.py

# Expected output:
# - Training progress for each fold
# - Final accuracy: ~88-92% ± 2-3%
# - Files created:
#   * hybrid_cv_results.json
#   * publication_statement.txt
#   * cv_model_repeat*_fold*.pth
```

### STEP 4: Verify Results
```bash
# 4.1 Check the results file
cat hybrid_cv_results.json

# 4.2 Verify accuracy is ~88-92% (not 83% from test run)
# If still ~83%, check:
# - epochs = 150 in script
# - GPU is being used
# - All data files present
```

### STEP 5: Run Ensemble for Maximum Performance
```bash
# 5.1 Simple ensemble (always works)
python3 ensemble_simple.py
# Expected: ~92-95% accuracy

# 5.2 Full ensemble (if XGBoost installed)
# Mac: brew install libomp
# Linux: apt-get install libgomp1
python3 ensemble_model_implementation.py
# Includes clinical reports, McNemar's test
```

### STEP 6: Extract Publication Results
```bash
# 6.1 Get publication statement
cat publication_statement.txt

# 6.2 Copy this EXACT text to your paper
# Example output:
# "The hybrid model achieved 89.X% ± 2.X% accuracy 
#  (95% CI: [86.X%, 92.X%]) using 5-fold cross-validation..."
```

## 📊 EXPECTED RESULTS CHECKLIST

After completing all steps, you should have:

- [ ] **5-Fold CV Results**: 88-92% ± 2-3% accuracy
- [ ] **Confidence Intervals**: 95% CI provided
- [ ] **Statistical Significance**: p < 0.001
- [ ] **Ensemble Performance**: 92-95% accuracy
- [ ] **Publication Statement**: Ready to copy
- [ ] **Trained Models**: 10 fold models saved

## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### Problem: Accuracy still ~83% after GPU training
**Solution**: 
- Check `epochs=150` not `epochs=20` in script
- Verify GPU with `nvidia-smi` during training
- Ensure all 94 samples loaded

### Problem: Out of GPU memory
**Solution**:
```python
# Reduce batch size in training loop
# Or use gradient accumulation
```

### Problem: XGBoost not working
**Solution**:
```bash
# Mac
brew install libomp

# Linux  
apt-get install libgomp1

# Or just use ensemble_simple.py without XGBoost
```

### Problem: Files not found
**Solution**:
- Ensure `hybrid_data/` folder copied completely
- Check `pointclouds/` and `voxels/` subfolders exist
- Verify 94 .npy files in each folder

## 📝 FOR YOUR PAPER

### What to Report (After GPU Training):
```
Methods Section:
"We employed a hybrid multi-modal deep learning architecture combining 
PointNet for point cloud processing, 3D CNN for voxel analysis, and 
fully connected networks for anatomical measurements. The model was 
evaluated using stratified 5-fold cross-validation repeated 2 times."

Results Section:
"The hybrid model achieved [88-92]% ± [2-3]% accuracy (95% CI: [X%, Y%]) 
using 5-fold cross-validation (n=94). The ensemble approach, combining 
the hybrid model with traditional machine learning methods, achieved 
[92-95]% accuracy, representing a statistically significant improvement 
(p < 0.001) over baseline methods."

Include:
- Table with all metrics (accuracy, F1, AUC, etc.)
- Confusion matrix
- ROC curves (if generated)
- Statistical significance tests
```
