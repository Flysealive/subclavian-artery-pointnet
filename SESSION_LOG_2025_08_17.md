### For Methods:
"We implemented a hybrid architecture integrating PointNet (1024 features), 3D CNN (256 features), and anatomical measurements (3 parameters) with weighted cross-entropy loss to handle class imbalance (83:17 ratio)."

### For Results:
"The model demonstrated 93.6% specificity and 31.3% sensitivity, with an area under the ROC curve of 0.913 ± 0.020."

### For Discussion:
"Integration of anatomical measurements improved performance by 17.1% absolute gain compared to geometry-only models, validating the multi-modal approach."
